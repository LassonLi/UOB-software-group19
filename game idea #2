Game idea : [Survivor.io]

There will be a character that the player will control. 
At each level of the game, waves of zombies will surround and be centred towards the player.
At different levels of difficulty, the zombies will become increasingly harder to kill. 
The player will be able to move around the map, collecting gems to upgrade their weaponry or health items. 
To demarcate the end of one level, there will be a larger wave of zombies, to pass the level, the player will need to survive a time frame.
The interface should show :

1. the player 
2. health bar 
3. the level of the game 
4. bar to show the amount of gems needed before next upgrade

twist: 
we will have our own types of zombies and there will be less gems needed to collect, however they would be of a higher impact. 

difficulty:
1. creating different maps that allows for the player to interact with and keeps the player within bounds of the game 
2. getting the zombies to follow the player despite the player being able to move freely 
3. the angle of the weaponry, how close the zombies has to be to be kill , where should the weapon hit the zombie to kill it 
4. how can the player collect the different gems automatically
